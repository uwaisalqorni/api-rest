## Run The Server

In the project directory (./rest-api-nodejs), you can run:

### `npm run start`

The server is running on [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001).\
\
If you can not run the server, try to do this:
### `npm init` or `npm install`
\
If you want to build the project from zero by yourself (not from this source code), you can follow my tutorial on my youtube channel [here](https://www.youtube.com/c/BabyProgramming).
